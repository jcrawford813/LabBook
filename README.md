# LabBook Demo
This is a project based on one that was written many years ago as I learned how to program. I have adapted it to be a learning ground for myself as I work through the concepts of Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture.

While this could be used in an actual setting, this is mostly intended to be a demo and sample for learning.

## Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:
- .NET Core 7.0
- .NET MVC 7
- Entity Framework
- XUnit
- Moq
